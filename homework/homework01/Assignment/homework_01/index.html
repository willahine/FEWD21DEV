<h2>History</h2>


<p>The Xia dynasty (Chinese: 夏朝; pinyin: Xià Cháo; Wade–Giles: Hsia-Ch'ao; IPA:
[ɕiâ tʂʰɑ̌ʊ̯]; c. 2070 – c. 1600 BC) is the first dynasty in traditional Chinese
history. It is described in ancient historical chronicles such as the Bamboo
Annals, the Classic of History and the Records of the Grand Historian.
According to tradition, the dynasty was established by the legendary Yu the
Great<sup>1</sup> after Shun, the last of the Five Emperors, gave his throne to him.
The Xia was later succeeded by the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC).</p>


<p>According to the traditional chronology based upon calculations by Liu Xin, the
Xia ruled between 2205 and 1766 BC; according to the chronology based upon the
Bamboo Annals, it ruled between 1989 and 1558 BC. The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology
Project concluded that the Xia existed between 2070 and 1600 BC. The tradition
of tracing Chinese political history from heroic early emperors to the Xia to
succeeding dynasties comes from the idea of the Mandate of Heaven, in which
only one legitimate dynasty can exist at any given time, and was promoted by 
the Confucian school in the Eastern Zhou period, later becoming the basic
position of imperial historiography and ideology. Although the Xia is an
important element in early Chinese history, reliable information on the history
of China before 13th century BC can only come from archaeological evidence
since China's first established written system on a durable medium, the oracle
bone script, did not exist until then;<sup>2</sup> however, no mention of the Xia, or
the supposed conquest of the Xia by the Shang, is found in any oracle bones
found to date. The first documentary reference to the Xia dates from more than
a thousand years later. Thus, concrete existence for the Xia is yet to be
proven, despite efforts by Chinese archaeologists to link the Xia with Bronze
Age Erlitou archaeological sites.<sup>3</sup></p>

<h3 id="tradacct">Traditional accounts</h3>

<p>The Xia dynasty was described in classic texts such as the Classic of History (
Shujing), the Bamboo Annals, and the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) by
Sima Qian. According to tradition, the Huaxia were the ancestral people of the
Han Chinese.<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup></p>

<h2 id="origins">Origins and early development</h2>

<p>Traditional histories trace the development of the Xia to the legendary Three
Sovereigns and Five Emperors. According to ancient Chinese texts, before the
Xia dynasty was established, battles were frequent between the Xia tribe and
Chi You's tribe. The Xia tribe slowly developed around the time of Zhuanxu, one
of the Five Emperors. The Records of the Grand Historian and the Classic of
Rites say that Yu the Great is the grandson of Zhuanxu, but there are also
other records, like Ban Gu, that say Yu is the fifth generation of Zhuanxu.
Based on this, tradition ascribes the ancestry of the Xia clan to Zhuanxu.<sup>

<h3 id="guns">Gun's attempt to stop the flood</h3>

<p>Gun, the father of Yu the Great, is the earliest recorded member of the Xia
clan. When the Yellow River flooded, many tribes united together to control and
stop the flooding. Gun was appointed by Yao to stop the flooding. He ordered
the construction of large blockades to block the path of the water. The attempt
of Gun to stop the flooding lasted for nine years, but it was a failure because
the floods became stronger. After nine years, Yao had already given his throne
to Shun. Gun was ordered to be imprisoned for life to reform the Eastern
Barbarians by Shun at Yushan (Chinese: 羽山), a mountain located between modern
Donghai County in Jiangsu Province and Linshu County in Shandong Province.<sup>

<h3 id="yu">Yu the Great's attempt to stop the floods</h3>

<p>Yu was highly trusted by Shun, so Shun appointed him to finish his father's
work, which was to stop the flooding. Yu's method was different from his
father's: he organized people from different tribes and ordered them to help
him build canals in all the major rivers that were flooding and lead the water
out to the sea. Yu was dedicated to his work. People praised his perseverance
and were inspired, so much so that other tribes joined in the work. Legend says
that in the 13 years it took him to successfully complete the work to stop the
floods, he never went back to his home village to stop and rest, even though he
passed by his house three times.<sup>citation needed</sup></p>

<h2 id="est">Establishment</h2>

<p>Yu's success in stopping the flooding increased agricultural production (since
the floods were destructive). The Xia tribe's power increased and Yu became the
leader of the surrounding tribes. Soon afterwards Shun sent Yu to lead an army
to suppress the Sanmiao tribe, which continuously abused the border tribes.
After defeating them, he exiled them south to the Han River area. This victory
strengthened the Xia tribe's power even more. As Shun aged, he thought of a
successor and relinquished the throne to Yu, whom he deemed worthy. Yu's
succession marks the start of the Xia dynasty. As Yu neared death he passed the
throne to his son, Qi, instead of passing it to the most capable candidate,
thus setting the precedent for dynastic rule or the Hereditary System. The Xia
dynasty began a period of family or clan control.^[citation needed] It is
believed that Zhenxun (modern Gongyi) was one of the capitals of the dynasty.</p>

<h2 id="over">Overthrow</h2>

<p>Jie, the last king, was said to be corrupt. He was overthrown by Tang, the
first king of the Shang dynasty. Tang is said to have given the small state of
Qi as a fief to the remnants of the Xia ruling family.</p>

<h2 id="modern">Modern skepticism</h2>

<p>No mention of the Xia dynasty survives from anything near contemporary sources.
Oracle bones dating from the Shang dynasty, which otherwise record ancestral
rulers from the supposed time of the Xia, and conflicts of the Shang with even
relatively small tribes, do not mention the existence of the Xia, or the
conflict between the Shang and the Xia recorded in later sources. The first
written mention of the Xia dynasty does not occur until the Western Zhou
dynasty, with references on bronzeware. Narratives of Xia dynasty people and
events do not appear until sources dating from later in the Zhou dynasty.</p>

<p>The paucity of written evidence and the time gap between the supposed time of
the Xia and the first written references to it have meant that the historicity
of the Xia dynasty itself and the traditional narrative of its history is at
best uncertain. The Skeptical School of early Chinese history, started by Gu
Jiegang in the 1920s, was the first group of scholars within China to
systematically question the traditional story of its early history. By
critically examining the development of the narrative of early Chinese history
throughout history, Gu concluded "the later the time, the longer the legendary
period of earlier history... early Chinese history is a tale told and retold
for generations, during which new elements were added to the front end".^[6]
Among other points, Gu and other historians note certain parallels between the
traditional narrative of Xia history and Shang history that suggest Zhou-era
fabrication or at least embellishment of Xia history. Yun Kuen Lee's criticism
of nationalist sentiment in developing an explanation of Three Dynasties
chronology focuses on the dichotomy of evidence provided by archaeological
versus historical research, in particular the claim that the archaeological
Erlitou Culture is also the historical Xia dynasty. "How to fuse the
archaeological dates with historical dates is a challenge to all chronological
studies of early civilization."<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>In The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China, Sarah Allan
noted that many aspects of the Xia are simply the opposite of traits held to be
emblematic of the Shang dynasty. The implied dualism between the Shang and Xia,
Allan argues, is that while the Shang represent fire or the sun, birds and the
east, the Xia represent the west and water. The development of this mythical
Xia, Allan argues, is a necessary act on the part of the Zhou dynasty, who
justify their conquest of the Shang by noting that the Shang had supplanted the
Xia.</p>

<h2 id="arch">Archaeological discoveries</h2>

<p>See also: Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project</p>

<p>Archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs that
point to the possible existence of the Xia dynasty at locations cited in
ancient Chinese historical texts. There exists a debate as to whether or not
the Erlitou culture was the site of the Xia dynasty. Radiocarbon dating places
the site at c. 2100 to 1800 BC, providing physical evidence of the existence of
a state contemporaneous with and possibly equivalent to the Xia dynasty as
described in Chinese historical works.^[7] In 1959, a site located in the city
of Yanshi was excavated containing large palaces that some archaeologists have
attributed to capital of the Xia dynasty. Through the 1960s and 1970s,
archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs in the
same locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts regarding Xia;<sup>8</sup> at a minimum, the Xia dynasty marked an evolutionary stage between the late
neolithic cultures and the typical Chinese urban civilization of the Shang
dynasty.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p>In 2011, Chinese archaeologists uncovered the remains of an imperial sized
palace—dated to about 1700 BC—at Erlitou in Henan, further fueling the
discussions about the existence of the dynasty.<sup>9</sup></p>

<h2 id="sov">Sovereigns of the Xia dynasty</h2>

<p>The following table lists the rulers of Xia according to Sima Qian's Shiji.
Unlike Sima's list of Shang dynasty kings, which is closely matched by
inscriptions on oracle bones from late in that period, records of Xia rulers
have not yet been found in archeological excavations of contemporary sites, or
records on later Shang dynasty oracle bones.</p>
