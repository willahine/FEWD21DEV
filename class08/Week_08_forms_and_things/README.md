###Week 8 - Forms

This week, students learn about forms. This week offers the possibility to take the course further. If your class is advanced, you can discuss GET methods and local storage. 

Lesson 16 is about using forms to build a web-based to do list app. This continues the theme of building in concert. Students build the entire app from scratch after a class discussion about the features it should have.   

For [homework](Assignment/README.md), students have the option to build a form for the Relaxr project or to begin working on a form for their final project.  

###Final Project Milestone 3

By week 8, you should have submitted a draft of the JavaScript and jQuery you'll need for your final project.  This week, focus iterating on your project to turn in an updated draft.
